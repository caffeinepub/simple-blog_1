      "featureTitle": "Review and improve the image/file upload hook in frontend/src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts. Improve the supported file type validation to accept common formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF). Increase or clearly enforce a practical max file size limit with a user-facing error message when exceeded. Improve canvas-based compression to better preserve image quality — consider increasing the max dimension from 1024px to 1600px and the JPEG quality from 0.75 to 0.85. Ensure the Uint8Array conversion is reliable and handles edge cases (empty files, corrupt input) gracefully with error feedback.",
