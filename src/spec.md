# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add category selection dropdown with predefined Swedish blog titles to help users create posts more easily.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Kategori" dropdown with five Swedish categories (Livsstil, Livsberättelser, Mat, Hobby, Djupa tankar) positioned before the title input field
- Add a "Föreslagen titel" dropdown that displays predefined title suggestions based on the selected category
- Auto-populate the "Titel" field when a user selects a suggested title, with the ability to edit it
- Make both dropdowns optional so users can skip them and enter custom titles directly

**User-visible outcome:** Users can optionally select a blog category to see relevant title suggestions, making it easier to start writing posts. They can also continue creating posts with custom titles without using the dropdowns.
